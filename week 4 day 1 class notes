scope is defined at the function level in javascript
var a = "will" --> this is global
global means entire program 
function () {
var b = "shep"	
}
if you have a variable outside of a function it is global
if you want in just one place you need to put inside of a function and that is LOCAL

jQuery begins!!
- it makes dom manipulations easiers, ie. GetElementById, document.onkeyup
- it's a library like bootstrap so you don't have to do your query manipulations by hand
function will return an object

jQuery is good for removing HTML elements and registering events and animating HTML elements
- include a cdn link to the jQuery script
- utilizing the jQuery specific ($) selector
$("#clickMe")-- syntatic sugar, is an object, # means id just like css
- jQuery function is .on("click", function ()) {
	
}
- string inturbolation
